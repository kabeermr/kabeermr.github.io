I am currently a final year PhD student at the Australian National University under the supervision of [Amnon Neeman](https://maths.anu.edu.au/people/amnon-neeman). Most of my research is on derived and triangulated categories in the context of algebraic geometry. Recently, I have been working with derived categories arising in noncommutative algebraic geometry too.
